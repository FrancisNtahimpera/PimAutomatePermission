The script starts by checking if the AzureRM module is imported. If not, it installs it and imports it to use Azure cmdlets in the script.

Then the script authenticates to Azure using the current credentials. Make sure you are signed in to Azure before running the script.

Variables are defined to store the necessary information:

$roleAssignmentName: The name of the role assignment you want to create (make sure it is unique).
$principalId: The ID of the principal to whom you want to assign the role.
$resourceGroup: The target resource group for role assignment.
$roleDefinitionName: The name of the role you want to assign (for example, "Contributor" for a contributor).
$pimConfigId: The PIM configuration ID (if using PIM).
$permanentEligible: A flag (true or false) to determine whether the assignment should be permanent.
$endDate: The end date of the assignment if it is not permanent.
The script attempts to check if the specified role definition ($roleDefinitionName) exists in Azure. 
If it does not find it, it displays an error message and exits the script.

If the role definition exists, the script creates the role assignment using the information provided.
 This assignment is based on the specified role and applies to the principal in the given resource group.

If you are using Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and have provided a PIM configuration ID ($pimConfigId), 
the script configures the PIM settings for this assignment. This may include options such as tenure and end date of the award.

The script displays a success message if the role assignment is created successfully.

If there is an error while running the script, it displays an error message to let you know what happened.

Finally, the script logs out of Azure to end the session.

This script helps automate the creation of role assignments with or without the use of Azure Privileged Identity Management, 
depending on your needs. Be sure to customize the variables to reflect your own Azure configuration.
