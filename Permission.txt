The permissions required to run a script that creates role assignments in Azure depend on the context and 
the specific resources you are accessing. 

Here is a list of permissions  to run 
the script:

Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write: This permission is required to create role assignments.

Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/delete: If you need to delete existing role assignments, you will 
need this permission.

need read permission on the role definitions.

Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/list: If you need to list all available role definitions, you 
will need this permission.

Microsoft.Graph/users/read: If you are using user-based principals (for example, Azure AD accounts), 
you will need permission to read information about those users.

Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignmentSchedule/write: If you are using Azure Privileged Identity 
Management (PIM) and you are configuring schedule settings, you will need this permission to write 
these settings.
